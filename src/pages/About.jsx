            <p>We are Manuel Tavares and Pedro Lopes, two future Web Developers.</p>
            <p>Even though one of us does not like to cook, the other still felt like it is a useful skill.</p>
            <p>As such: have a gander and pick your poison! We have anything your cooking self might need.</p>
            <p>Have a care about the time it takes to make, though... choose wisely!</p>
